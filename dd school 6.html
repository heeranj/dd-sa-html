<h2>1. The Earliest Drums
The very first drums to be discovered and known to men is called the Alligator Drum. This instrument is made from clay and alligator hides bounded together by a kind of durable string.

</h2>

<h2>2. The Largest Drum Set
The cliché saying that one is never enough is embodied in this next interesting fact. See the video to witness how an avid drum aficionado pursued his dreams of building the largest drum set in the world.


This magnificent collection of drums and other percussion instruments was developed by a full-time minister that describes himself as “an Agent of Rhythm”. Dr. Mark Temperato which is also a professional musician lovingly collected and assembled the world’s largest drum set for 35 years to fuel his passion on drums. His drum set is composed of a wide variety of drums, cymbals, and other equipment with almost over 50 different kinds of make and model. This set is stored and transported in a custom 18-wheel tractor trailer which needs three to four people and 15 hours to set up.
</h2>
<h2>
3. War Drums
Other than sacred religious rituals, one of the earliest known function of beating the drums is for war. Back in the day when there was no access to modern mobile communication like radio, cellphone, or internet, the military used snares and its relatives to send coded messages to soldiers. This communication system has played a very important role in medieval and Renaissance Europe. It was said that drums were also used to send messages over long distances between villages in Africa and India.

4. The World’s Biggest Drum
We are not exaggerating when we say that the radius of the largest drum is longer than the height of an average human person. It is so big you would initially think from afar that it is just a colorful and artsy cylindrical room. But, it is definitely not just colorful and artsy. It also produces some awesome sounds and provides some awesome beats. The CheonGo drum, as is called in traditional Korean, was created in a small town of South Korea. It weighs a generous amount of 7 tonnes and measures 5.54 m (18 ft 2 in) in diameter.

<h2>
5. The World’s Tallest Drum
The world’s tallest drum was unveiled a few years back at the Nigerian Drums Festival. This festival aimed to feature and empower the rich African cultural heritage through drums. It was during this event that the 18-feet high drum (which was an improvement from the last 17-feet) was unveiled by Governor Ibikunle Amosun. This drum is claimed to be the tallest in the world and it definitely further fostered the spectacle that the event organizers are going for.

It is no wonder why this particular drum set was easily sold at an auction. And it is definitely a give-away why it is the most expensive one sold as of to date.

Sir Ringo Starr, as he is now referred to these days, is famous worldwide for being the drummer of the Beatles and it is apparent that his drum set became famous like him as well.

The drum set was sold at a Julien’s Auction in California on December 5, 2015. One can say that it is essentially an ordinary drum set. But it was one that was purchased by Ringo Starr in 1962 and it was said to have been used in at least 200 performances. Because of this, the drum set was sold at a whopping $2.1 million!

<h2>
7. Acoustic drums are often augmented with electronic parts
Drums were not spared with the effects of modern technology at the dawn of the new era. During the 80s everything was slowly becoming electronic and digital. This includes the drums. It was at this period where the electric drums became very popular. Super popular in fact that its popularity threatened to phase out the traditional drums. However, that never fully happened.

Traditional drums have a timbre that’s difficult to replace. However, the variety of sounds that electronic introduce are difficult to ignore. Many drummers use drum triggers to augment the sounds of their drums, along with other hybrid setups.

Drumming can burn a lot of calories and keep you in shape. Particularly, if you’re a hard hitting drummer then you may be surprised at how much of a workout you’re getting when drumming. A study by Chichester University measured the heart rates for a sample of drummers and found that a big drumming session could bring them to near-max recommended heart levels, a similar rate that would be experienced with high intensity exercises.

In fact, there’s even a movement of exercises classes known as Cardio Drumming that takes advantage of this!
